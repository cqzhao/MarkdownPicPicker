## Attention

As Qiniu will delete your domain after 30 days, it will not be recommanded anymore. I will write plugin for Tencent Cloud instead.

## Introduce

MarkdownPicPicker is an assistant which can help you add picture in Markdown. It will upload the image in your clipboard to web picture host and copy the Markdown-format link(\!\[\]\(url\)) to your clipboard or pasteboard. Now it supports Windows and Mac OS.
